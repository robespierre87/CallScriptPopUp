  <p>Hi [First Name], this is Jim from MentisSoft.</p>
  <p>We help private K-12 schools streamline their business administration. I find that the solutions that are out there are reasonably good but really expensive or reasonably priced but causing a lot of extra admin time. So I'm calling to set up some time with you to see whether we can help you save time, money, or both. Would ____ morning or _____ afternoon work better?</p>
